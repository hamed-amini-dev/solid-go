# SOLID Principles in Go

This repository demonstrates the application of SOLID principles in Go, showcasing best practices for building maintainable, scalable, and clean software architecture. Each principle is illustrated with clear examples and explanations, providing insights into how these principles can enhance code quality and reduce technical debt.

SOLID Principles Overview

    •	Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
    •	Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
    •	Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
    •	Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): No client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use.
    •	Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

Examples

    •	Each SOLID principle is implemented through practical Go code examples.
    •	The repository includes detailed comments and documentation for ease of understanding.

Why SOLID Matters

Adopting SOLID principles in software development helps improve the flexibility, reusability, and testability of the codebase. These principles are foundational for writing clean code, a key expectation in professional development environments.
